Setup
=====

Step 1
~~~~~~

In your models.py add the field comments (Please note that field name
must be ``comments`` not ``comment``) to the model for which comment
should be added (e.g. Post) and the appropriate imports as shown below:

.. code:: python

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericRelation
    from comment.models import Comment

    class Post(models.Model):
        author = models.ForeignKey(User)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        body = models.TextField()
        # the field name should be comments
        comments = GenericRelation(Comment)



Step 2
~~~~~~

``get_comments`` *tag uses 2 positional and 3 optional args*:

    1. The instance of the model. (positional)
    2. User instance. (positional) 
    3. oauth. (optional - Default is false)
    4. profile_app_name. (optional)
    5. profile_model_name. (optional)


``include_static`` this tag will include required jquery and javascript
file. ``include_bootstrap`` for bootstrap 4.1.1 if itâ€™s already included
in your project, get rid of this tag.

In your template (e.g. post-detail.html) add the following template tags
where object is the instance of post.

.. code:: python

    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag
    {% get_comments object request.user %}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object
    {% include_bootstrap %} # Include bootstrap 4.1.1
    {% include_static %} # Include jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file

If you have profile model for the user and you would like to show the
profile image on each comment you need to pass the profile_app_name and
profile_model_name arguments to get_comments tag. (e.g if user profile
app is called ``accounts`` and profile model is called ``UserProfile``)
the tag will look like the following:

.. code:: python

    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag
    {% get_comments object request.user profile_app_name='accounts' profile_model_name='userprofile'%}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object
    {% include_bootstrap %} # Include bootstrap 4.1.1
    {% include_static %} # Include jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file
